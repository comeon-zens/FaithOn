## Tesla’s flat spiral coils and the speed of electricity

### Situation analysis

In relativistic physics, the idea that something moves faster than light is unbearable. They have even gone so far as to postulate the speed of light as a fundamental constant.
In Dr. Max Planck's book "Introduction to the Theory of Electricity and Magnetism" from 1922, dynamic processes in moving bodies are explained in detail in seven paragraphs (§ 96 to § 102). Not only is Lorentz's electrodynamics reconciled with the principle of relativity in one sentence, but the theory of knowledge from mechanics is also confirmed:

"A. Einstein has shown the way out of this captious dilemma (Ann. d. Phys. 17, p. 892, 1905) by asserting that Lorentz's equations of electrodynamics, like the exact fundamental equations of mechanics, are indeed completely invariant in the transition from a coordinate system at rest to one moving with uniform velocity, but that for this transition one must not use the Galilean transformation (I. (194)) for this transition, but that another transformation, now called the Lorentzian transformation, must be introduced, which can be regarded as a generalization of the Galilean transformation insofar as it merges into the latter for the value c = ∞."[1]

In other words, Lorentz's equations (473) and (474) are compatible with the principle of relativity. For this purpose, H. A. Lorentz established the ether at rest in his theory. This alone mediates all electrodynamic effects. Matter, on the other hand, moves against the ether at a speed q and only has a secondary effect on the electromagnetic field.
The fact can be described mathematically as follows: "[...] that in the differential equation (460) the term with q, and in the differential equation (469) the corresponding term for rarefied gases do not actually exist."

In 1834, Sir Charles Wheatstone conducted an experiment to determine the speed of electricity in a cable. He found that it travels at approximately 463,491,072 m/s.[2][3] Nikola Tesla also knew that electricity in an electrically conductive medium travels faster than an electromagnetic wave in the air, which propagates at approximately the speed of light. His patent specifications describe an experiment in which a standing wave moves at a speed of 471,240,000 m/s in an electrically conductive medium, such as the earth.[4]

### Derived research questions

**Question:** How can the validity of the theory described above be tested?

**Answer:** By using Tesla's flat spiral coils. They have two main different resonant frequencies, depending on the connection configuration. It is clear that if the outer end of the secondary coil is connected to another one, the resonant frequency is higher than if the inner ends of the secondary coils are connected. The coils behave similarly to that of two identical tuning forks in different media. It is clear that depending on the medium, an electromagnetic wave also moves at different speeds. In this case, in an electrically conductive medium.

The images below show the differences in electromagnetic fields between the two possible configurations of the flat spiral coils. Figure two, with an inner/inner configuration, clearly demonstrates that the E-field undergoes a relative phase shift to the B-field in the centre of the coil surface of the secondary coil. In contrast, the outer/outer configuration shows the maximum. This is irrefutable proof that the inner/inner configuration emits the electromagnetic wave into the air, while the outer/outer configuration favours the electrically conductive medium. The H-field also differs from the configuration and helps to explain the behaviour of the flat spiral coils with its different resonance frequencies.

### Goal of the project
This project will build a communication system with two different flat spiral coil pairs using the inner/inner configuration. The result will be similar to optical communication systems using an optical fibre with different frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum (Electron and Positron).

### Possible areas of application:
- Control of pipeline inspection robots, but also for water basins and sewage treatment plants
- Communication for underwater measurement systems or for smart farming sensors
- Communication via a cable car system between valley and mountain
- Communication during the shell construction of high-rise buildings
- Communication for shielded environments and bunker systems
- Camera systems within a Faraday cage (shipping containers)
- V2X communication for cars and other installations
- Mobile communication systems for disaster areas
- Communication via the internal power grid
- Camera system for long trucks and trains
